UI clean-up needed
* More explanations and guidance
* Validation for usernames in create-user dialog
* Create/Cancel buttons shouldn't be equal prominence - flip left/right and make cancel buttons into a link
* sub-nav-bar for Train/Models/Test/Scratch to avoid need to go back to project page
* Restore the Quiz

New features
* Support for deleting labels in training
* Editing examples
* Expiry for models
* Multiple credentials pool per class
* Numbers training
* Images training
* Scratch blocks for collecting training data
* Allow longer field names

Code / engineering work
* Test coverage for DB errors
* Set up DB and Auth0 for prod vs dev use

Longer term goals
* Restore sprites library

Worksheets
* Refer to "Back to projects" as a link, not a button
* Journey to School project
* Make me happy - make the scratch project first, rules-based, to demonstrate the need for ML. Call out to explain the motivation. THEN start training.
* "Testing your training" not a clear phrase
* Highlight in the screenshots - arrows for what to click, highlight the new blocks, etc.
* Explain how to duplicate costumes
