UI clean-up needed
* Validation for usernames in create-user dialog
* Create/Cancel buttons shouldn't be equal prominence - flip left/right and make cancel buttons into a link
* sub-nav-bar for Train/Models/Test/Scratch to avoid need to go back to project page
* Document differences with regular Scratch
* Warn about pop-up blocking in Scratch page

New features
* Editing examples
* Expiry for models
* Multiple credentials pool per class
* Images training - built around a WikiMedia library?
* Scratch blocks for collecting training data

Code / engineering work
* Test coverage for DB errors
* Set up DB and Auth0 for prod vs dev use
* Fix the UI for browsers other than Chrome
* Scratch keys should use project id as primary key so REPLACE is more efficient

Longer term goals
* Restore sprites library

Worksheets
* Journey to School project
