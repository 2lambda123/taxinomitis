UI clean-up needed
* Logo
* Add a sub-nav-bar for Train/Learn/Scratch to avoid need to go back to project page
* Document differences with regular Scratch

New features
* Images training - built around a WikiMedia library?

Code / engineering work
* Setup prod clone of auth0 for dev
* What happens if the access token expires while you're using it. Can we refresh/replace it?
* Figure out logging for prod
* Set up cfbot for prod monitoring
* Delete entire project is actually calling taxinomitis-numbers during tests
* Some sort of admin controls for me so I'm not SQL'ing in a prod DB
* Compose dashboard supports MySQL backups - need to set a reminder to do this

Longer term goals
* Restore sprites library to scratch-flash
* Support for training text in languages other than English

Worksheets
* Shakespeare or Dahl (text)
