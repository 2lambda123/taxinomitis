Thanks very much for getting in touch.

I've set up a new class account you can access using:

    username:  USERNAME
    password:  PASSWORD

You can download a PDF which describes how you can get started at
https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/docs/pdf/machinelearningforkids-schools.pdf

In particular, please take note of item 4 - "reviewing your class limits".

Machine learning models that your students train are created using Watson API keys from IBM Cloud.

Models for recognising images are created using "Visual Recognition" API keys. I've only added a single Visual Recognition API key, so you can try out projects to train a computer to recognise images. That won't be enough to cover a class. (one API key = one student).
If you give me specific dates of when you'll do image projects, I'll try to borrow image API keys from other groups that aren't using them on those days.

API keys for projects to recognise text and numbers are much cheaper, so I don't need to be as restrictive with those.

If any of this doesn't make sense, please get in touch.

But please make sure you are aware of the limits before using it with a class for the first time.

Kind regards
