This is an automated email from Machine Learning for Kids.

You're receiving this email because you created a class account with Machine Learning for Kids.

A regular check of the Watson Conversation credentials that you provided for use by Machine Learning for Kids found a machine learning model (what Conversation calls a "workspace") that isn't known to Machine Learning for Kids.

The workspace ID is:Â WORKSPACEID

How could this happen?

Reason 1)
You're using your Watson Conversation credentials for other things as well as Machine Learning for Kids, and you intentionally created another workspace for another reason.
That's fine! Just ignore this email.
But be aware that they count towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your credentials, so that will mean one fewer model that can be created by your students.

Reason 2)
Something went wrong when the workspace was being deleted and it was left behind accidentally.
It should be deleted as it counts towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your credentials, and so will mean one fewer model that your students can create.
If you know how, feel free to delete it yourself using the Watson Conversation UI or API.
If you don't, please just send an email to dale.lane@uk.ibm.com and I'd be happy to do it for you.


You won't be notified about this workspace again.

Kind regards

Dale
