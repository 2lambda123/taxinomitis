            Spotify has asked Machine Learning for Kids to slow down how much this website is using their service.

        <div class="help-section">
            They provide their "API" (a way that a website can get information from the Spotify service) for free,
            but have some rules on how it is used. One of these rules is to ask people to not use it too much too
            quickly. The Machine Learning for Kids website has currently exceeded this limit, and is being "rate
            limited".
