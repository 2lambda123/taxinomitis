    <h4>'images' projects</h4>
    <h5 style="padding-left: 1em;">Dragging images into the training buckets doesn't work if you're using Safari or Internet Explorer</h5>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Sorry about this. If you can use another browser like Firefox or Chrome, please do that. Otherwise, you can click the "Add example" button and paste in the URL of training pictures instead. </div>
    <h5  style="padding-left: 1em;">Errors about 'unsupported file type' when training a model</h5>
    <div style="padding-left: 3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">You can only use jpg or png images to train the computer with. I haven't got the web tool to help you make sure you only collect jpg and png pictures yet, so you need to try and be careful for now. I will fix this though so the training tool makes sure you collect the right files only. </div>
