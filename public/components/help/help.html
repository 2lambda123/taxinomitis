                    Machine Learning for Kids uses Scratch 2. Scratch needs Adobe Flash to work, so you need to be using an operating system
                    and a web browser that can work with Flash (so that means no iPads for now, sorry).

                    Occassionally, the Scratch blocks for your machine learning model can lose the connection to the server. When this happens, they will stop returning results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You can check whether this has happened using the coloured status light in the "More Blocks" palette.

                    <p>
                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is red, that normally means something is wrong. It might be a temporary problem. Try saving
                    your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Save Project'), then refresh the browser page. If the status light goes green after the page reloads, you can load your
                    project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Load Project') to pick up where you left off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the
                    "Learn &amp; Test" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is green, then the blocks should be working. If you're not getting the responses you expect
                    from them, try going to the "Learn &amp; Test" page and checking what results your model returns.
