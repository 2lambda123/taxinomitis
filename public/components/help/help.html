                    Machine Learning for Kids uses Scratch 2. Scratch needs Adobe Flash to work, so you need to be using an operating system
                    and a web browser that can work with Flash (so that means no iPads for now, sorry).

                    Occassionally, the Scratch blocks for your machine learning model can lose the connection to the server. When this happens, they will stop returning results.

                    <p>
                    You can check whether this has happened using the coloured status light in the "More Blocks" palette.

                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is red, that normally means something is wrong. It might be a temporary problem. Try saving
                    your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Save Project'), then refresh the browser page. If the status light goes green after the page reloads, you can load your
                    project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Load Project') to pick up where you left off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the
                    "Learn &amp; Test" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.

                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is green, then the blocks should be working. If you're not getting the responses you expect
                    from them, try going to the "Learn &amp; Test" page and checking what results your model returns.

                    The Teacher's page shows the number of machine learning models available to your class. (This page is only accessible to
                    teachers or group leaders). This value is calculated by taking the number of API keys / credentials that the teacher has
                    created, and multiplying it by the number of machine learning models that can be created with a single API key.

                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation">Watson Conversation</a> credentials, as this supports
                    20 "workspaces". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Conversation credentials by 20 when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their text projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Lite Plan" supports only 5 "workspaces", so if any of the Watson Conversation credentials were created in the Lite
                    pricing plan, then this means the actual limit will be less than displayed on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">images</span> projects, the assumption is that "Lite Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/watson_vision_combined">Watson Visual Recognition</a> API keys,
                    as this supports 1 "custom model". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Visual Recognition API keys by 1
                    when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their images projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Standard Plan" doesn't have a limit on the number of custom models, so if any of the Watson Visual Recognition
                    API keys were created with the Standard pricing plan, this means there isn't actually a limit on the number of machine
                    learning models for images projects, despite what is shown on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sorry for any confusion that this page causes. I will be updating the Teacher's admin page so it asks for the Pricing Plan
                    for each set of credentials or API keys, so that I can do the appropriate multiplication in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the meantime, the correct limit is whatever is shown on IBM Cloud where the credentials are created. More detailed
                    information about all of this can be found in this
